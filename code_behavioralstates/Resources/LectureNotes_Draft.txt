Day 4: Behavioral States - What is a behavioral state and how can we define it?

 
General lecture: What is a behavioral state?
Overview of behavioral states with a focus on biology and ethology

Descriptions of behavioral states in multiple species ->  states are a general phenomenon in animal behavior.
Why do behavioral states matter and why should we care about them?

Relationship between sensory input and motor response depends on behavioral state. 

Emerging appreciation in the field at large that variability in neural activity (e.g. variability in sensory responses) can be partly explained by taking account of state (internal/brain/behavioral states). 

Shifting paradigms in neuroscience. Historically experimenters sought to tightly constrain behavioral states with task design, but there is a trend to relax control to allow more “natural/ethological” behaviors. BUT a big drawback is complexity → Need analysis methods to parse this complexity, particularly with respect to nonstationary behavioral states.
